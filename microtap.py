"""A TAP producer for MicroPython environments.

Summary
-------

This is a TAP producer that is meant to be used as part of CI/CD pipelines for
MicroPython projects.  This is written with MicroPython's limitations in mind
and its execution environment is not limited to MicroPython's Unix or Windows
ports.  That means that with a small bit of hardware (say, a Wifi/UART
controlled relay and a UART-to-WiFi bridge) a CI/CD pipeline can build a test
runner image for a particular device, deploy it on the device itself, and
after performing a device reboot run the test suite.  The output can be
captured and be handled by a TAP consumer for further processing or display.
This module follows TAP specification version 14 (it can be found at
https://testanything.org/tap-version-14-specification.html).

Current limitations
-------------------

- Test plans and test points must reside on a filesystem

  Since this should also run on MicroPython's Unix and Windows ports, the test
  plans and their test points must reside on a filesystem.  This is not
  usually a problem for most MicroPython targets, but if your device does not
  have enough flash space then some modifications of this module are in order.
  This will be addressed in a later version of this module.

- No nested test plans.

  At the moment test plans cannot define their own nested sub-plans.  Usually
  this is not a problem as test points and their plans are grouped by file.
  This will be addressed in a later version of this module.

- Test plans can only be in a single directory.

  To keep things simple, right now the test plans discovery phase does not
  recurse into directories when looking for eligible files.  This may not be a
  limit as MicroPython projects do not tend to be that large and therefore the
  amount of test code shouldn't require multiple directories.  This will be
  addressed in a later version of this module.

- No automatic test plan and test points extraction.

  Whilst MicroPython does allow module contents enumeration, its introspection
  capabilities are limited by design.  So for now a manual registration
  process is used.  Depending on MicroPython's introspection capabilities this
  may or may not be addressed in a later version of this module.

- No way to add set up/tear down procedures.

  Right now there is no support for per-test plan or per-test point
  set up/tear down procedure.  Each test point has to sort it itself for the
  time being.  This may or may not be addressed in a later version of this
  module.

- No test point execution timeout.

  Since test points may interact with hardware and literally hang the device,
  tests may have to handle this themselves.  The main issue here is lack of
  uniform watchdog support on all MicroPython targets (`machine.WDT` only
  supports six targets at the time of writing), and the fact that once the
  machine watchdog is enabled the `machine.WDT` module offers no facility to
  switch it off.  Also, tests may dealt with hardware peripherals and do all
  sorts of weird things to the board they run on.  For this very reason, all
  output is not buffered and the stream is flushed right after every line.
  This introduces a bit of latency but if the device hangs or reboots or
  whatever else, the CI/CD will still catch up to the last line being output.
  Right now the best option is to configure your CI/CD output parser to detect
  some text indicating the device booted up and some other text indicating the
  test session ended.

How to use
----------

`find_test_plans` must be run to check any file named `test_<something>.py` in
the directory it is asked to look into and will return a list of all test plans
it finds in the files it read.  These test plan instances must then passed to
`execute_test_plans` for them to be run and evaluated.  So, in the simplest
case tests can be run with `execute_test_plans(find_test_plans())`.  Now,
`execute_test_plans` by default prints the test execution result to
`sys.stdout`; this may not be desirable as for example test code will print
information there that will interfere with the TAP output report.  In this
case, a `stream=` argument can be passed to `execute_test_plans` to redirect
the TAP report output to another opened file, or another UART or even a IÂ²C or
SPI bus stream instance.

Test files are loaded and their root level code is executed - this is where
test plans must be defined by calling `build_plan` to build a test plan
container with an optional description (and whether to mark it as skipped).
The returned object (an instance of `Plan`) can then be fed test points via
its `add_test_point` method where functions that take no arguments and return
nothing can be added as test entry points, along with an optional description.
The `Plan` objects that are created this way are automatically extracted by
this module, so they can be discarded right away.

Test points when executed can signal their state to the module by raising four
different exceptions (each exception allows for a message to be passed):

- Skip

  If a test raises this exception it signals that its execution should not be
  counted due to external circumstances that prevent this test to run, and it
  is assumed as if it was successful (as per TAP specifications).

- ToDo

  If a test raises this exception it signals that its execution should not be
  counted due to the test itself being incomplete, and it is assumed as if it
  was a failure (as per TAP specifications).

- Fail

  If a test raises this exception it signals that its execution was stopped
  due to an exception being caught or to an error being detected by the test
  itself, and the test run is marked as a failure.

- BailOut

  If a test raises this exception it signals that the whole test session
  should be aborted, and no further testing should take place.

The functions and the exceptions mentioned above are injected into the test
file's execution scope, but can also be imported from the `microtap` module to
allow IDE autocompletion support, for other tools perform type checking, and
so on.

Security notes
--------------

The test plan extraction process executes foreign code.  If an attacker
takes control of the CI/CD machine or the source code repository then it may
add malicious code in the test files.  In the former case (the CI/CD machine
being compromised) tough luck, but if test files are modified there may be a
chance for bad things to happen if this module runs on selected MicroPython
ports (namely Unix, Windows, and anything else with a WiFi/Ethernet interface
being used).

**Use this at your own risk.**

    sure test files do not have any dots in them, as otherwise Python's import
    mechanism will break.

    This means that root level code in test files will be executed, and in
    that execution scope the following entities are injected:

        - `build_plan`, which is a function that allows to create a test
          plan.  This returns an instance of `Plan`, which allows to add
          tests to the plan for later evaluation.
        - `Skip`, which is an exception that tests must raise to mark their
          execution as skipped by the test runner.
        - `ToDo`, which is an exception that tests must raise to mark their
          incompleteness to the test runner.
        - `Fail`, which is an exception that tests must raise to mark their
          failure as internally detected.
        - `BailOut`, which is an exception that tests must raise to mark the
          end of the testing session as an impossibility to continue was
          detected.

    Test files must call `register_plan` to build a test plan bound to the
    file, and subsequently call `add_test_point` on the returned `Plan`
    object to add test points.  Whilst MicroPython does allow module contents
    enumeration, its introspection capabilities are limited by design.  So
    for now a manual registration process is used - this may change in the
    future once MicroPython's introspection capabilities are investigated in
    depth.

    Registered test points will be called with no arguments, and if a extra
    set up or tear down steps are required, the test point itself must handle
    it on its own for now.

    If more than a plan is provided, each plan will be handled as if it
    were a sub-plan of the root plan (which contains no test points).

    Parameters
    ----------
    plans : Union[Plan, Sequence[Plan]]
        The plans to execute.  This does not have to be a Sequence, but can
        also be a single Plan instance.
    output_stream : TextIO, optional
        An optional text stream to write the result to.  If not passed, it
        defaults to `sys.stdout`.
    root_plan : bool, optional
        An optional flag indicating whether a fake root plan should be
        generated if more than one plans are to be executed.  This is here to
        accommodate viewers like `tap.py`, which cannot handle no root plan
        with one or more sub-plans.  `tapview` handles the lack of root plan
        just fine for example, so this requires a bit of trial and error.
        The TAP specification version 14 does not seem to indicate this is a
        possible case so here we are...
